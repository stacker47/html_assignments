        Cricket is an exciting outdoor game in India and is played in many countries worldwide. However, it is not so
        popular in the United States. Played is a fascinating game in many countries like India, England, and Australia.
        It is a beautiful game played using a bat and a ball in the open space on the big field. It is my favourite
        sport. I generally used to see only cricket on the TV whenever any national or international cricket competition
        occurred. In cricket, two teams have 11 players in each team. One team starts batting first, and another team
        does bowling according to the toss winning. The team who wins the toss does batting first; however, both teams
        can do batting alternatively.

        There are many rules in cricket, and one cannot play cricket without properly knowing the laws and regulations.
        It is played well when play ground becomes dry. However, there exist some problems when the ground gets wet. One
        batsman gets a chance to do batting until he gets out of the game. Whenever a match starts, everyone’s
        enthusiasm runs high, and a high pitch sound of people gets spread all over the stadium, especially when the
        favorite batsman does through a chauka or chhakka ball. Sachin Tendulkar is my famous cricketer and would-be. He
        had made a new record in the cricket history of India. I forgot to eat anything for the whole day whenever he
        played his cricket match at the national or international level.
